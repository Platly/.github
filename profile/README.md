# Platly

Platly is a personal platform engineering project created for exploration, learning and experimentation with modern cloud-native tools.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is **not production-grade** - it’s just a **learning playground** designed to explore the patterns, tools and practices used in building internal developer platforms (IDPs) using open-source technologies.

## 🔍 What you'll find here
### 🚧 WIP

This organization may include:

- Infrastructure as code (Terraform & Crossplane)
- GitOps bootstrapping patterns (e.g. App of Apps)
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- Experiments with self-service templates
- Custom tooling, CLIs, or dashboards (if any)

## 🤔 Why this exists

Platly was created as a space to:
- Practice real-world platform engineering workflows
- Learn modern GitOps and Kubernetes-native patterns
- Experiment with developer self-service approaches
- Build infrastructure and developer experience from scratch

## 📌 Disclaimer

> This project is purely experimental and is **not intended for production use**.  
> It may contain incomplete setups, broken examples or WIP ideas.
